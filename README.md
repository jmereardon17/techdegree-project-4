# Techdegree Project 4

For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I had to build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.

I went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to further enhance the project by adding additional placeholder text for the other text fields, the required attribute to other input fields, a background color for one of the main sections of the site, additional styling enhancements to the form like the transition property and background color fade in and out for focus states.

For this project I was responsible for creating a sass project, using partials, variables, extends, and mixins to apply the styles to rules for mockups of mobile and desktop layouts using the provided index.html file with a set of class names already defined. I styled the web page using each of those class names. This project provided me with a set of classes that I can use in other projects to apply similar styles. The outcome of this project has given me a Sass micro-framework that I can use to quickly prototype other websites.

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to create a flexbox mixin to apply flexbox properties within my project, and a media query mixin to apply all my media queries.
