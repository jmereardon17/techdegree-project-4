# Web Style Guide

A sass micro-framework that can be used to quickly prototype other websites which is a treehouse FEWD techdegree project. Using partials, variables, extends, and mixins that I created to apply the styles to rules for mockups of mobile and desktop layouts using the provided index.html file with a set of class names already defined. I styled the web page using each of those class names. This project provided me with a set of classes that I can use in other projects to apply similar styles.

For the highest grading of the project on the techdegree, I had to develop the following:
- Create a Flexbox mixin to apply to all Flexbox properties used in the project.
- Create a media query mixin to apply to all the media queries used in the project.

Browsers tested for compatibility:
- Chrome

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
